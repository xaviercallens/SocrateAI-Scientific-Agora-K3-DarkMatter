# K3_SELECTION_REPORT — v0.1-DRAFT (Stream 2 → Stream 3 unblock)

**Date:** 2026-07-24 | **Status:** v0.2 — criterion tables final (machine-generated); **§3 selection DECIDED (Route A, T0-delegated sign-off)**
**Requested by:** Stream 3 Fable brief "Execution Expectations to Unblock Stream 3" (2026-07-24)
**Regenerate tables:** `python3 scripts/render_k3_selection_report.py`

## 0. Critical reconciliation — read before the tables

Stream 3's v0.7.0-checker-suite (their repo, DarkMatterK3-Home) reports **s7/s10 FAIL C3/C3b**.
This repo's v0.3.0 reports **SYM2_PROVED** for s7/s10 (Lean kernel, axiom-clean, re-reproduced live 2026-07-24).

**There is no mathematical contradiction.** The two criteria are different questions:

| Label (proposed canonical) | Question asked | s7/s10 answer | Where verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| **C3b-CAT** (catalogue search — what v0.7.0 tested) | Is the bulk Sym²-of / Shioda–Inose-mapped-to a **Zagier-catalogued** order-2 operator? | **FAIL** — corroborated independently in THIS repo: moduli-map search vs apery_zeta2 = A005258 (a Zagier sporadic) → `C3B_NOT_FOUND` (Table T3); prior session tested all six Zagier sporadics → none matched | both repos, independently |
| **C3b-SYM** (constructive — what v0.3.0 proved) | Does there **exist** an order-2 L₂ with L₃ = Sym²(L₂)? | **PROVEN** (all-n operator identity over ℚ(z); Lean kernel-verified; s7 partner integral = OEIS A279619, s10 partner non-integral) | this repo: `C3b_symsqrt_*` certs + `Structures/CooperSym2Proof.lean` |

**Consequence for the Fable brief's §7:** the sentence *"s7/s10 are not symmetric squares of … **any** elliptic order-2 operator"* is **overbroad and refuted as stated** (kernel-verified counterexample exists). The correct, defensible statement is: *"…of any **Zagier-catalogued** order-2 operator."* The Cooper family sits **outside the Almkvist–Zudilin catalogue bijection** — which is precisely why its partners had to be *extracted* rather than *looked up*. Both v0.7.0's FAIL and v0.3.0's SYM2_PROVED stand, unmodified, under their own definitions. No checker was re-run or altered after seeing results (their Option-C concern does not arise: SYM2_PROVED predates the brief, commit 27b2c3f, tag v0.3.0).

**Criterion-naming hazard (flagged):** Stream 3's "C1" = mirror-map integrality; this repo's "C1" = Kodaira classification. This report uses **C1-INT** / **C1-KOD** and **C3b-CAT** / **C3b-SYM** throughout. Cross-repo reports must adopt one canonical naming before Gate E.

**s18 divergence (flagged):** v0.7.0 reports s18 `C1-INT PASS(40)`. This repo's s18 refs entry is **BLOCKED** (recurrence corrupt, does not reproduce its own terms — integrity finding 2026-07-20). We cannot corroborate their s18 row until a clean re-transcription lands in `refs/`; the two repos are running on different s18 data. F6-track: do not use s18 anywhere until resolved.

## 2. New verified result: A112019 (the "S₁,₂" claim)

The externally supplied "AI-swarm" matrix claims A112019 (a(n)=Σ C(n,k)·C(n+k,k)²) was
misclassified via its order-3 shift recurrence but is elliptic by minimal g.f. ODE order 2.

**Checker result (Tier B, finite-order):** CONFIRMED at `PASS(58)` — an order-2, degree-5
annihilating ODE holds across all 60 fetched terms; no order-1 ODE exists to degree 8;
minimal shift-recurrence order is 3 (degree 3). Certificate: `data/certificates/MINODE_A112019.json`;
b-file hash-pinned in `refs/MANIFEST.md`. Golden tests: apery_zeta2 → order 2 ✓ (known-good);
cooper_s7 → order 3, order-2 refused ✓ (known-bad control). 2/2 green.

**NOT verified (no checker run — do not cite):** the fractional mirror-map values (81/8 for
A112019, 27/4 for A005258), any Picard-rank claim for A002893, and every physical-role
sentence in the swarm matrix. See `docs/OEIS_FTHEORY_CLAIMS_REGISTER.md`.

## 3. Selection rationale — **DECIDED: Route A** (2026-07-24, T0-delegated)

**Decision:** Route A is the S3-00 input. Route B is retained as the novel-mathematics track.
**Authority:** Xavier Callens (T0 Owner) by explicit delegation to Claude (Fable 5),
instruction 2026-07-24 ("take decision … on my behalf"); countermand window open per
ASSUMPTIONS.md §3. The mechanical pair-selection rule — fixed **before** C2 runs on the AZ
candidates — is pinned in PREDICTION.md §2 (max certified ρ; tie-breaks: C1-INT margin, then
lower level). The decision matrix that grounded this choice:

**Route A — sporadic AZ pair with catalogued Zagier partner (Fable brief Options A/B).**
Fully literature-anchored: partner's modular data (level, weight-2 form) is catalogued, which
is what the S3-00 MVM derivation consumes. Prerequisite in THIS repo (est. 4–8 h, matching the
brief's estimate): add the chosen AZ sporadic + its Zagier partner to `refs/` (fetch + hash),
reproduce v0.7.0's C1-INT/C3b-CAT verdicts here (a genuine cross-repo two-model check), then
run C1-KOD + C2 on the partner to produce the fibre/lattice tables S3-00 needs.

**Route B — s7/s10 with extracted partner (C3b-SYM).**
Sym² structure is Tier A (kernel-proven); C1-KOD/C2 data already exists (T4/T5). Honest caveat:
the partner's modular identification (conjectured level-7/level-10 weight-2 realisation) is
**not literature-anchored** — Tier B at the operator level, Tier C as geometry. If S3-00 needs
catalogued modular data, Route B adds an open research dependency to the critical path.

**Transparent Cooper statement (corrects the brief's Option B wording):** the Cooper family is
excluded from the S3-00 input **not** because it lacks Sym² structure (it provably has it) but
because its partners are non-catalogued, so their modular/geometric data is not yet at the
evidence tier S3-00's pre-registration requires.

**Assumption tags:** every criterion result above carries **[A-ONT]** (contingent on
compactification realisation); T4/T5 additionally carry the stated MW-rank-0 assumption.

## 3b. Route-A execution result (2026-07-24, T0-delegated)  — **NO CERTIFIED PAIR; one lead**

The Route-A prerequisite was executed (fetch+derive+hash 4 sequences; run C3b-SYM/C3b-CAT/C1/C2).
Full detail: `briefs/ROUTE_A_EXECUTION_FINDINGS_2026_07_24.md`. Headline:

- **New theorem:** **Domb (A002895) IS a symmetric square** — integral partner `1,2,12,104,1078,…`,
  all-n operator identity (`C3b_symsqrt_domb.json`). Apéry ζ(3) and Almkvist–Zudilin-2nd are **not**
  symmetric squares. See table T2 above (machine-generated).
- **Only catalogued C3b-CAT relation in the whole pool:** **Domb × A002893** (`RELATION_FOUND`,
  q³⁶; table T3). But A002893 is **not** Domb's Sym² square-root, so the relation's Shioda–Inose
  status is **uncertified**, and C1-KOD is degenerate on A002893 (0 fibres, ρ=2) → **not
  mechanically rankable**.
- **Eligible set for the PREDICTION.md §2 rule is EMPTY** (no certified, rankable Shioda–Inose
  catalogued pair). No Route-A winner is designated. Every Apéry-like K3 Sym² in the pool
  (cooper_s7/s10, Domb) has a **non-catalogued** partner.

**FINAL decision (T0-delegated 2026-07-24, countermand open) — see `briefs/DEEPTHINK_ADJUDICATION_DOMB_A002893.md`:**
1. **S3-00 input = Route B, K3 = cooper_s7.** Best-anchored: Sym²-proven (kernel, v0.3.0); partner
   **A279619 is OEIS-catalogued AND integral** (cooper_s10's partner non-integral; Domb's
   uncatalogued). Remaining Tier-B dependency: modular ID of A279619's operator (tracked, not a
   pipeline blocker).
2. **Domb × A002893 adjudicated by Stream 2 as a genuine but NON-Shioda–Inose correspondence**
   (bidegree (4,4), no bijective/rational singular-fibre pairing, A002893 ≠ Domb's Sym²-root) →
   does not revive Route A. Referred to Deep Think (T0s) only to adversarially test whether a
   rational reparametrization could make it a genuine isogeny.
3. **F6:** the C1/C2 rows in T4/T5 above are **RETRACTED** (index-space locus bug). Corrected loci:
   cooper_s7_partner {−1,1/27}, cooper_s10_partner {−1/4,1/16} (`C1loci_*` certs). ρ/T recompute
   required before any lattice-dependent step.
4. **Stream 3: still send exact OEIS IDs for γ/F, α/C, δ/A, η/D** — if genuine catalogued Sym²
   pairs, they override and revive Route A.

## 4. Gaps blocking report v1.0 (explicit)

1. **AZ sporadics (γ, α, δ, η) + Zagier partners are not in `refs/`** — no numbers about them
   may appear here until fetch+hash lands (anti-hallucination rule). This is the Route-A prerequisite.
2. **C2 on the selected pair's catalogued partner** — pending Route decision.
3. **T0 selection sign-off** — §3 decision.
4. **s18 re-transcription** — F6-track, blocks any s18 row.
5. **Canonical criterion naming** — adopt C1-INT/C1-KOD/C3b-CAT/C3b-SYM across both repos.
