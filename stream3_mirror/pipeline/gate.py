"""Mechanical gates on `PREDICTION.md` (prereg-pipeline skill, CLAUDE.md rules 1 & 3).

Two distinct gates live here. Keeping them separate is the whole point:

**G1 — real-data access.** `PREDICTION.md` must carry a `PINNED: <sha256>` header
before any real-data comparison runs. Pre-pin, only synthetic-data infrastructure
is permitted. This is what `require_pinned_for_real_data()` enforces.

**G1-L — TEST/FIT labelling.** A pin alone does NOT make a comparison meaningful.
The pin covers the pre-registration *rules* (`PREDICTION.md` §2–§5: the selection
rule, the observable decision rule, the TEST/FIT split, the kill condition). It does
not supply the *numbers* — m_φ, α_D, Λ_D live in §6, which is "Empty by design at
v1.0-PINNED" and is populated only by a completed, two-model-agreed S3-00 derivation.
Labelling an output `TEST` claims it tests a pre-registered prediction; with §6 empty
there is no such prediction, so the honest label is `SYNTHETIC`. That is what
`labels_unlocked()` / `require_derived_for_labels()` enforce.

Why this exists: WP S3-00b (2026-07-25) hit falsification branch F5b — the flux/tadpole
construction needed for a₁, a₂, a₃ is blocked, so §6 will not be populated on the
cooper_s7 branch at all. Before this module distinguished the two gates, opening G1
caused `observables.py` to stamp placeholder computations `FIT`/`TEST` with nothing
behind them. See `NO_PREDICTION_BRANCH.md` §8 and `briefs/GATE_G1L_RULING_2026_07_25.md`.

This module reads files and reports state; it does not decide policy.
