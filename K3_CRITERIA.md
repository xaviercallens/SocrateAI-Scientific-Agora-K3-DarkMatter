# K3_CRITERIA — Frozen Selection Criteria for K3 Vacuum Candidates

**Status:** BIFURCATED — **CANDIDATE REGISTER (§1) FROZEN 2026-07-20** (register-level, two-model + Xavier, decision D5); **CRITERIA THRESHOLDS still SKELETON, NOT FROZEN** (§7 pre-freeze checklist open: C1 N₁, C3b N, C4 requirements, C5 bounds, scoring weights are all `TBD-AT-FREEZE`).  
**Freeze target (full criteria v1.0):** end of Phase 0 (week 2), jointly signed per the two-model rule (`EXECUTION_PLAN.md` §1.2.3) and by Xavier. The register freeze below does NOT constitute the full v1.0 freeze.  
**Repo of record:** `SocrateAI-Scientific-Agora-K3-DarkMatter`. **This file is that copy** — made
canonical here on 2026-09-21 (T0, AM-5), seeded byte-identical from the Stream 1 LeanProposal copy
at its commit `6c09d2d` (seed commit `f62f2c8`) and then amended by AM-1…AM-4 of
`briefs/K3_CRITERIA_AMENDMENT_PROPOSAL_2026_09_21.md`; record `briefs/T0_DECISIONS_2026_09_21_STREAM2.md`
(D8′). The copies in the Stream 1 and Stream 3 repositories are **mirrors** from now on, hash-pinned
against this file; they are not independent authorities. Establishing this copy is **not** a freeze:
the thresholds remain SKELETON and §7 still blocks v1.0.

> **Open items carried into this copy, visible rather than inherited silently.**
> (a) §1 is FROZEN (D5, 2026-07-20) and is copied **untouched**, including `K-S22` and `K-t103`;
> Stream 1's `briefs/T0_FLAG_K3_CRITERIA_T103_STALE_2026_08_01.md` (t103 was never vetoed — E-014)
> is still unanswered, so §1's t103 row is stale-but-frozen and needs a T0 ruling, not an edit here.
> (b) §5's table is not regenerable in this repository — see §5.
> (c) Several `TBD-AT-FREEZE` markers remain (C4, C5, §4); per the `criteria-checkers` contract,
> implementing those is blocked until the freeze resolves them.

> **Freeze semantics.** After v1.0 is frozen: (1) AutoEvolve may score candidates *only* through the checker scripts listed here; (2) no criterion, threshold, or weight may change except by a versioned amendment (§6) recorded *before* re-running any ranking; (3) every `TBD-AT-FREEZE` field below must be resolved with a literature citation or a first-principles computation — an unfilled TBD blocks the freeze.

> **2026-07-17 update:** Added criterion **C3b** (Shioda-Inose moduli map) per the Phase 0 architecture revision in `DUAL_SCALE_THREE_STREAM_PLAN.md` and `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` WP S2-01/S2-01b. C3b gates eligibility for `PREDICTION.md`'s S3-00 MVM matching. See `ASSUMPTIONS.md` (draft, unverified) for the load-bearing assumptions this criterion and its downstream use depend on. This file remains **SKELETON v0.1, NOT YET FROZEN** — the C3b addition does not itself constitute a freeze.

## 1. Candidate Register

| ID | Sequence / family | Defining recurrence (source) | Order-2 partner claimed | Initial flags |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| K-s7 | Cooper s7 | Cooper (2012) Ramanujan J. 29 Table 1, params (13,4,−27,3); encoded `Agora/Sequences/CooperRecurrences.lean` | TBD (C3b/Stream 2, exhibit L₂) | `SYM2_SYMBOLIC`, `C3B_UNVERIFIED`, **`TIER_A_POOL`** |

| ~~K-S22~~ | ~~Cooper S22~~ | **DROPPED 2026-07-18** — uncitable (E-001) | — | `DROPPED` |
| ~~K-t103~~ | ~~t103~~ | **DROPPED 2026-07-18** — uncitable; "AESZ 103" is order-4 CY3, category error (E-001) | — | `DROPPED` |

*Rule: a candidate without a citable defining recurrence at freeze time is dropped, not guessed.*

> **2026-07-18 candidate-register amendment (T0, Opus 4.8, delegated authority).** Resolving

> **2026-07-20 CANDIDATE-REGISTER FREEZE (decision D5 — authorized: Deep Think T0s + Xavier T0).**
> The candidate register (this §1 — the candidate *set* and its tier assignment) is now **FROZEN**.
> The full-criteria v1.0 freeze is separate and still pending (§7 TBDs unresolved). Bifurcation:
> - **`TIER_A_POOL` = {K-s7, K-s10}** — both closed forms are kernel-validated (golden values
>   n=0–19 *and* closed-form-vs-recurrence n=1–18, `native_decide`; see
>   `Tests/CooperSequences.lean`) and both are two-model `SYM2_SYMBOLIC`. Cleared to advance
>   into Stream 2's C3b (Shioda–Inose) ranking. **Final selection *between* s7 and s10 is D4
>   (Stream 2 / C3b + C1/C2), pending Xavier's physics evaluation — NOT decided here.**
> - **`TIER_B_QUARANTINE` = {K-s18}** — represented by sourced params + recurrence-validated
>   goldens only; its p.3 closed-form transcription disagreed with the recurrence at n=3
>   (ℕ-truncation / signed-binomial edge). Held out of the Tier-A pool until Fable + Deep Think
>   resolve the n=3 combinatorial edge case. Do NOT delay downstream work for it.
>
> **Honest scope of "Tier A" here:** it means the candidate's *closed-form encoding* is kernel-
> validated over a bounded range (golden values n=0–19 AND closed-form-vs-recurrence n=1–18, both

## 2. Criteria

Template per criterion: **Definition** (mathematically exact) · **Checking procedure** (first-principles, no LLM recall) · **Checker script** · **Pass threshold** · **Failure consequence** · **Tier**.

### C1 — Mirror-Map Integrality
- **Definition:** the mirror map q-expansion coefficients of the candidate's Picard-Fuchs operator, in the normalization fixed at freeze (state it explicitly), are integers up to order N₁.
- **Checking procedure:** compute the holomorphic solution and mirror map symbolically (Sage/sympy, exact rational arithmetic — no floats), expand to N₁ terms, test integrality.
- **Checker:** `checkers/check_C1_mirror_integrality.py` — deterministic; emits per-coefficient certificate JSON.
- **Threshold:** all coefficients integral for n ≤ N₁. **N₁ = TBD-AT-FREEZE** (proposed: 200; justify choice at freeze). *Note: finite-order integrality is evidence, not proof; report as `PASS(N₁)`, never `PASS`.*
- **Failure:** F1 removal.
- **Tier:** B → A(N₁-bounded) on pass.

### C2 — Transcendental Lattice (T2) — *amended 2026-09-21 (AM-3); replaces the Kodaira criterion*
- **Definition:** the family's transcendental lattice satisfies `T ≅ U ⊕ ⟨2n⟩`, certified with a
  **serialized base-change witness** and an **independent re-derivation** (producer ≠ verifier),
  and then accepted by T0. A DRAFT certificate is **not** a pass and **not** a failure.
- **Checking procedure:** exact integer arithmetic on the monodromy-invariant lattice; the witness
  `P` is re-applied by the verifier, and `Pᵀ G P = U ⊕ ⟨d⟩`, `d = |det| = 2n` are recomputed.
- **Checkers:** `checkers/check_U1_lattice.py`, `checkers/check_U1_witness_serialization.py`,
  `checkers/independent_rederivation_C2_s10_v4.py` (+ their control files).
- **Status:** `cooper_s7` LIVE (`C2_cooper_s7_v5.json`, T0 D5′); `cooper_s10` **DRAFT**
  (`C2_cooper_s10_v4_DRAFT.json`, kept DRAFT by T0 D6′) ⇒ every s10 statement resting on it is
  ADVISORY.
- **Threshold:** exact; the identification of the monodromy-invariant lattice with `T` is Tier B via
  the read framework sources (Dolgachev 1996 §7, Doran 1998 Thm 5.13).
- **Failure:** F1 removal — **only** on a certificate whose verdict fails, never on DRAFT status.
- **Tier:** B.

> ~~**C2 — Kodaira Fiber Content.** The Weierstrass model associated to the candidate family has
> singular fibers whose Kodaira types are all on the physical list … Checker
> `checkers/check_C2_kodaira.py`; threshold exact; failure F1 removal; Tier B → A on pass.~~
> **RETRACTED and replaced (E-007, F6; ledger item 3).** Kodaira readings are a category error for
> this register: the finite singular loci are order-2 elliptic points of the `X₀(n)⁺` modular curve,
> not Kodaira degenerations. The v1 C1/C2 Kodaira certificates (`2×II`, ρ = 4, T = 18) are retracted
> in-band. `check_C2_kodaira.py` must not be run on a register candidate. The full original text is
> preserved in git history at commit `f62f2c8` (the byte-identical seed of this file).

### C3 — Symmetric-Square Structure (from VISION §1.1, amendment A2)
- **Definition:** the candidate's order-3 operator L₃ equals Sym²(L₂) for an explicitly exhibited order-2 operator L₂ (equality of operators after the normalization fixed at freeze — state it).
- **Checking procedure (two independent routes, both required to clear the flag):**
  1. *Symbolic:* construct Sym²(L₂) explicitly and verify operator equality by exact coefficient comparison (`checkers/check_C3_sym2.py`).
  2. *Formal:* Lean statement `sym2_<candidate>` from Stream 1 WP S1-04; status auto-imported from the open-goal export.
- **Threshold:** route 1 pass clears `SYM2_UNVERIFIED` → `SYM2_SYMBOLIC`; route 2 kernel proof upgrades to `SYM2_PROVED`.
- **Failure:** symbolic route fails ⇒ F1 removal *for the dual-scale role* (the candidate may remain of independent mathematical interest, outside this program's physics).
- **Integrality is NOT part of C3 — literal reading, ruled by T0 2026-09-21 (AM-2, D8′).** The
  definition above asks for an *exhibited order-2 operator*, and nothing more. The partner
  **sequence**'s integrality is coordinate-dependent: the least `c` with the partner integral in the
  coordinate `cz` is 1 for `cooper_s7` and 2 for `cooper_s10` and `avs_sporadic3_s18`
  (`checkers/check_partner_global_boundedness.py`, `PARTNER_GLOBAL_BOUNDEDNESS.json`, PASS(160);
  the bound `e(n) ≤ n−1` holds for all n modulo two Stream 1 theorems). That constant is **reported
  as an attribute, never used as a gate and never scored.** Under this reading both register
  primaries clear C3.
- **Tier:** B → A on kernel proof.
- **2026-07-18 status + structural note (symbolic route done, T0).** `scripts/check_C3_symsquare.py`
  computes the self-adjointness polynomial `W = ⅓a₂″ + ⅔a₂a₂′ + 4⁄27 a₂³ + 2a₀ − ⅔a₁a₂ − a₁′`
  (Almkvist–van Straten arXiv:2103.08651; a 3rd-order operator is a symmetric square of a 2nd-order
  operator ⇔ `W=0`). Result: **s7, s10, s18 all give `W=0` → `SYM2_SYMBOLIC`** (controls pass;
  awaiting Deep Think two-model concurrence). **However `W=0` holds *identically* for the whole
  Cooper ansatz `θ³ − x(2θ+1)(aθ²+aθ+b) + x²(c(θ+1)³+d(θ+1))` — the Sym² property is AUTOMATIC for
  this operator form, so C3 is STRUCTURAL, not a discriminating filter.** Real candidate selection
  rests on C1, C2, **C3b (Shioda–Inose moduli map)**, C4, C5. C3 remains a required *consistency*
  gate (a candidate must be writable in this self-adjoint form), not a differentiator.

### C3b — Shioda-Inose Moduli Map (new, per T0 Architecture Review; see `DUAL_SCALE_THREE_STREAM_PLAN.md` §5, `ASSUMPTIONS.md` A-SEQ/A-VOL)
- **Definition:** for a candidate that has cleared C3 (order-3 operator L₃ = Sym²(L₂) for exhibited L₂), there exists an explicit Shioda-Inose correspondence map F relating the candidate's K3 family to the order-2 elliptic family, constructed as an algebraic relation or q-series expansion (normalization fixed at freeze — state it).
- **Checking procedure:** given the order-3 and order-2 Picard-Fuchs operators (hauptmoduls, from literature or C1/C3 output), construct F explicitly; expand both sides of the claimed correspondence to order N symbolically (exact rational arithmetic) and confirm equality. This is the *honest, checkable version* of any "rigid locking" claim — a per-candidate criterion, not an asserted theorem (see VISION §1.3 ruling: C3/C3b establish a geometric relation only, never by themselves a physical coupling).
- **Checker:** `checkers/check_C3b_moduli_map.py` — outputs F (polynomial/q-expansion), margin of agreement, certificate JSON. Golden tests required: one known-good pair (explicit F exists) and one known-bad pair (no F, or F disconnected/multivalued — the adversarial pass in `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` S2-05 must attempt to produce this case deliberately).
- **Threshold:** exact equality to order N (**N = TBD-AT-FREEZE**, propose matching C1's N₁ unless a different order is justified); report as `PASS(N)`, never `PASS`.
- **Failure:** F1 removal *for candidacy in the MVM matching pipeline* (S3-00 input) — same non-readmission rule as C3.
- **Tier:** B → A(N-bounded) on pass. **Only a C3b-passing candidate pair is eligible as S3-00 (MVM) input** — this criterion gates `PREDICTION.md`, not just `K3_SELECTION_REPORT.md`.

### C4 — Lattice / Picard Data Consistency
- **Definition:** the candidate family's generic Picard rank and transcendental lattice data (as computable from the Sym²/Shioda-Inose structure, with the method fixed and cited at freeze) are consistent with the structural requirements the physics construction imposes. **The requirements themselves are TBD-AT-FREEZE and must be derived from the EFT-matching draft, not chosen to fit preferred candidates.**
- **Checking procedure:** TBD-AT-FREEZE — specify the computation (e.g., via the exhibited L₂'s modular parametrization) and its tool.
- **Checker:** `checkers/check_C4_lattice.py`.
- **Threshold:** exact match to the stated requirement.
- **Failure:** F1 removal.
- **Tier:** B.

### C5 — Swampland / Consistency Bounds
- **Definition:** the candidate's moduli-space data satisfies each listed bound, with **every inequality written out explicitly at freeze** (bound, normalization, O(1) constant convention, and citation). No bound may be invoked by name alone.
  - C5.1 — Distance-conjecture-type bound: statement TBD-AT-FREEZE.
  - C5.2 — (Optional) additional consistency conditions: enumerate or delete at freeze.
- **Checking procedure:** compute the relevant moduli-space quantities from the Picard-Fuchs data symbolically; evaluate each inequality with stated conventions.
- **Checker:** `checkers/check_C5_swampland.py` — reports margin, not just pass/fail.
- **Threshold:** per-inequality, stated at freeze. *Honesty note: Swampland bounds are themselves conjectural; a C5 result is always reported as "consistent/inconsistent with conjecture X under convention Y," Tier B ceiling — never Tier A.*
- **Failure:** flag `SWAMPLAND_TENSION`, score penalty per §4; removal only if the freeze designates the bound as hard.
- **Tier:** B (ceiling).

### C6 — Definiteness cut (ρ = 20) — *added 2026-09-21 (AM-1); T0 D7′*
- **Definition:** within a register family, the **candidate surfaces** are the members whose
  transcendental lattice has rank 2 and is positive definite (ρ = 20) — the CM points of the
  family's modular curve. A member is named `(family, D, z)`, with `T_X` its reduced binary form.
- **Checkers:** `checkers/check_CM_points_rho20.py` (the table); `checkers/check_A2_membership.py`
  (occurrence criterion: **D occurs at level n iff D is a square mod 4n**, an all-vectors
  statement); `checkers/check_CM_completeness_classnumber.py` (completeness per listed discriminant).
- **Threshold:** membership is exact lattice arithmetic. Every `z` is a **numeric recognition**
  (fitted at one precision, re-checked at a strictly higher one) through a Hauptmodul relation
  quoted `PASS(N)`, and is reported as such.
- **Failure:** a proposed surface that is not a CM point of a register family is outside C6. No
  candidate is removed by C6.
- **What C6 is NOT** (the ruling is read narrowly; widening any of these needs its own T0 text):
  not a **ranking** — no ordering by `|D|`, no preference between families, and "A₂ is in the s7
  family and not in the s10 family" is a lattice fact; not **corroboration** — elliptic point ⇒ CM
  is forced, and the binary-form and modular sides agree by Shioda–Inose; not **complete** beyond
  the discriminants a certificate lists, since CM points are dense on the curve; not **physical** —
  no member maps to any observable (F5b, ledger item 4).
- **Tier:** B. **Scoring:** none — see §4.

### T1 — Modular coordinate — *added 2026-09-21 (AM-4); consistency gate, never scored*
- **Definition:** `L₂`'s coordinate is a Hauptmodul for an explicit genus-0 group, by an exact
  q-series identity, with cross-level negative controls.
- **Checkers:** `checkers/check_s7_hauptmodul_gamma07plus.py` (Γ₀(7)⁺),
  `checkers/check_s10_hauptmodul_gamma010star.py` (Γ₀(10)\*). Verdicts quoted `PASS(N)`.
- **Failure:** no removal; the candidate simply has no certified modular coordinate.
- **Tier:** B. **Scoring:** none.

### T3 — Level consistency — *added 2026-09-21 (AM-4); consistency gate, never scored*
- **Definition:** the `n` re-derived from the lattice certificate (C2) equals the level at which the
  candidate's inverse mirror map is verified to uniformize.
- **Wording that is part of the criterion:** these are **two disjoint computations on the same
  operator**, *not* independent measurements — both legs start from the same operator/recurrence.
  No text in this program may describe T3 as independent corroboration.
- **Checker:** `checkers/check_T3_level_consistency.py` (+ its control file).
- **Stated limits, part of the criterion:** no real candidate having **both** legs and disagreeing
  is known, so T3's discriminating power against such a candidate is **UNESTABLISHED**; and the
  teeth are **directional** — leg M is only ever run at the `n` the lattice names.
- **Atkin–Lehner:** the action of the Atkin–Lehner group on the discriminant form is **verified at
  lattice level** — `W(n) → O(q_A)` is an explicit isomorphism, `PASS(30)` over `n`
  (`ATKIN_LEHNER_DISC_FORM.json`); the former flag `ATKIN_LEHNER_ACTION_UNVERIFIED` is therefore
  retired. The one open flag on `cooper_s10` is `LATTICE_CERT_DRAFT`, a **process** item (C2 above),
  not a mathematical one. The two are never to be merged into one flag.
- **Failure:** disagreement is a finding to escalate, not an automatic removal.
- **Tier:** B. **Scoring:** none.

## 3. Checker Contract (applies to every `checkers/*.py`)

1. Exact arithmetic wherever mathematically possible; floats only with stated error bounds.
2. No network access; no LLM calls; inputs are the candidate register + fixed literature data files in `refs/` (each with SHA256 and source citation).
3. Deterministic and seeded; identical inputs ⇒ bit-identical certificate JSON.
4. Each checker ships with golden tests: one known-good control, one known-bad control (`EXECUTION_PLAN.md` S2-02).
5. Certificates are the only admissible evidence source for any table in any report.

---

## 4. Scoring (consumed by AutoEvolve)

- Hard criteria (fail ⇒ F1): **C1, C2, C3-symbolic** — TBD-AT-FREEZE: confirm the hard set.
- **A hard criterion is failed only by a certificate whose verdict fails.** A **DRAFT** or absent
  certificate is neither a pass nor a failure and triggers **no** F1 removal; it makes every
  statement resting on it ADVISORY. (Added 2026-09-21 with AM-3: `cooper_s10`'s lattice certificate
  is DRAFT by T0 D6′ and must not read as failing the amended C2.)
- **C6, T1 and T3 are neither hard nor soft: they are not scored at all.** C6 records which members
  of a family are candidates; T1 and T3 are consistency gates. None contributes a term to any score,
  and AutoEvolve may not read them as one.
- Soft criteria (margin-scored): C4, C5 — weights TBD-AT-FREEZE, fixed before any ranking run, hash-pinned with this file.
- Score formula: TBD-AT-FREEZE (proposed: lexicographic — hard criteria as gates, then weighted soft margins). AutoEvolve may not modify weights at runtime.

## 5. Live Status Table (auto-generated — do not edit by hand)

> **NOT REGENERATED IN THIS REPOSITORY — 2026-09-21, in band.** `scripts/render_status_table.py`
> **does not exist here and never has** (absence verified by repo search 2026-07-26,
> `briefs/STREAM1_S1_10_11_12_STATUS_AND_UNBLOCK_2026_07_26.md`; the `criteria-checkers` skill
> records citing it as a phantom-artifact incident under standing rule 4). The table that stood here
> was the pre-2026-07-18 skeleton — all `—` and `SYM2_UNVERIFIED` for s7/s10 — which contradicts
> every certificate now on `main`. Copying it into the canonical file would give a stale table fresh
> authority, and hand-editing it is the integrity incident this section itself forbids. It is
> therefore **removed, not edited** (original preserved in the seed commit `f62f2c8`), and until a
> renderer is written and committed:
>
> **The table of record is `data/certificates/`.** Each criterion's checker and certificate are
> named in §2 above; finite-order verdicts are quoted `PASS(N)` there.
>
> Open item: write `scripts/render_status_table.py` (reading certificates only, never hand input),
> then restore a generated table here. A hand edit remains a reportable integrity incident.

## 6. Amendment Protocol

1. Amendments by PR with: motivation, exact diff, and an impact statement listing every prior ranking invalidated.
2. Any amendment adopted *after* a ranking run demotes that run's outputs from "selection" to "exploratory" in all reports.
3. Amendments arising from Deep Think adversarial memos (`EXECUTION_PLAN.md` S2-05) cite the memo.
4. Version history:

| Version | Date | Change | Rankings invalidated |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1 | 2026-07-17 | Skeleton | n/a (no runs permitted pre-freeze) |
| v0.1a | 2026-07-18 | Candidate-register amendment E-001 (drop S22/t103; add s18) | n/a (pre-freeze) |
| v0.1b | 2026-07-20 | **Candidate-register FREEZE** D5 (register-level, two-model + Xavier): Tier-A {s7,s10} cleared for Stream 2; s18 → Tier-B quarantine. Criteria thresholds NOT frozen. Deep Think S2-05 memo cited | n/a (no ranking run yet) |
