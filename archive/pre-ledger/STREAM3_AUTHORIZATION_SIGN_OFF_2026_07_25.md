## DECISION AUTHORITY & GATE STRUCTURE

### Who Decides What

| Decision | Authority | When | Criteria |
|----------|-----------|------|----------|
| **D-3 Execution Start** | Xavier (T0) — delegated to Stream 3 ops | NOW (2026-07-25 18:00) | Pre-conditions all MET ✅ |
| **Phase 2 Continuation** (if marginal) | Xavier (T0) | 2026-07-26 06:00 | Go/no-go on batch progress |
| **Gate E Verdict** (PASS/CONDITIONAL/FAIL) | Xavier (T0) + Deep Think (T0s, advisory) | 2026-07-27 EOD | 6 technical criteria |
| **v0.4.0 Release** | Xavier (T0) | 2026-07-27+ | Conditional on Gate E PASS |

### Gate E Go/No-Go Criteria (MANDATORY)

**All 6 must PASS:**

| Criterion | Threshold | Evidence | Verifier |
|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| s7 pass rate | ≥95% | D3_AGGREGATE_VERDICT.json | Stream 3 |
| s10 pass rate | ≥95% | D3_AGGREGATE_VERDICT.json | Stream 3 |
| Lattice χ² (s7) | <1.0 @ 3σ | D3_STATISTICAL_REPORT.md | Stream 3 |
| Operator numerics | <1e-50 error | C3b_symsqrt_*.json | Stream 2 (pre-verified) |
| Mirror-map agreement | q⁶⁴ | C3b_symsqrt_*.json | Stream 2 (pre-verified) |
| Physics-washing audit | zero Tier C claims | D3_GATE_E_VERDICT.md | Xavier (final review) |

**Decision Logic:**
- **IF all 6 PASS** → **PASS** → v0.4.0 authorized
- **ELSE IF 5/6 PASS (marginal)** → **CONDITIONAL** → human review required
- **ELSE** → **FAIL** → hypothesis revision needed

## ASSUMPTION INTEGRATION FOR STREAM 3

### [A-ONT] Ontological Realization — TIER C FIREWALL ACTIVE

**Rule:** The dark-sector physics is *conjectured* F-theory; D-3 tests operator identity only.

**Stream 3 Instruction:** Report only Tier B observations:
- ✅ "Operator identity holds to required precision"
- ✅ "Lattice structure consistent with theory [A-ONT: F-theory]"
- ❌ "Bulk couples to brane" (without explicit [A-ONT] tag in same sentence)

### [A-SEQ] Sequence→Geometry Fidelity — TIER B LOCKED

**Rule:** Recurrences in `refs/` are frozen and faithfully encode operators.

**Stream 3 Instruction:** Use only committed recurrences; cite certificate source for every result.

### [A-VOL] Volume/Moduli Mediation — TIER C ASSUMPTION

**Rule:** Lattice priors (ρ=4, T=18) are fixed; no post-hoc tuning.

**Stream 3 Instruction:** If χ² > 1.0, escalate to Stream 2/Xavier (prior mismatch diagnosis).

### [A-REL] Scale-Relation Discipline — TIER A/C FIREWALL

**Rule:** Sym² relation is geometric (Tier A), not physical coupling (Tier C).

**Stream 3 Instruction:** FIREWALL: Any bulk↔brane statement requires [A-ONT] tag in-sentence.

### [A-DATA] Observational Data Integrity — TIER B

**Rule:** Public datasets fetched hash-pinned before any comparison.

**Stream 3 Instruction:** Never transcribe numbers from memory; always read from frozen manifest.

### [A-PIPE] Pipeline Neutrality — TIER B

**Rule:** v5 pipeline has zero tunable knobs; validated by golden tests.

**Stream 3 Instruction:** Golden tests must PASS before touching real sectors.

## CONTINGENCY & ESCALATION

### If GPU Unavailable
**Action:** Switch to CPU fallback (adds 4–6 days)  
**Report:** New ETA to Xavier immediately

### If D-3 Pass Rate Marginal (90–95%)
**Action:** Escalate to Xavier; may retry 50 sectors with relaxed bounds  
**Outcome:** Gate E CONDITIONAL

### If Lattice χ² > 1.0
**Action:** Escalate to Xavier + Stream 2 for prior adjustment + retry  
**Outcome:** Gate E CONDITIONAL

### If Physics-Washing Detected
**Action:** FAIL; report must be rewritten (Tier B/C markers)  
**Outcome:** Gate E FAIL

### Escalation Contacts
- **Stream 2 technical support:** [Stream 2 lead]
- **Gate E interpretation:** Xavier (T0)
- **GPU/infrastructure:** [Compute ops]
- **Physics-washing audit:** Xavier (T0)
